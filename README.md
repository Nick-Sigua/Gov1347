_An example blog for Gov 1347_

Tip: use **bold** and *italics* wisely -- **bold** is most effective for highlighting your big points as section headings or paragraph starters, while *italics* help draw attention to surprising statements, facts, or concepts. 

Here is an example blog post for reference. It's not perfect, but has the elements of a good election analysis blog.

## Polls

Can we trust polls? In 2016, many polls did not predict Trump's win. Below is the polling average across months leading up to 2016 election.

### Pollsters

+ Not all pollsters provide high quality data and interpretation. FiveThirtyEight provides *pollster ratings* based on the accuracy of their past prediction: [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/)

+ But it is important to note that even good pollsters often disagree. [Same raw data can lead to different predictions by renowned pollsters.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/20/upshot/the-error-the-polling-world-rarely-talks-about.html)

### Predictive Power

Polls do predict the outcome by and large.
