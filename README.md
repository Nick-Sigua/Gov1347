# How it works

You can either (1) use the mardown file of your team on our [GitHub project](https://github.com/Sun-Young-Park/Election-Analytics) to edit your page or (2) upload your pdf and tag it with the syntax below. ```markdown [title](filename.pdf)``` Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site.
