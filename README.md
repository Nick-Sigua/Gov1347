## How it works

Students can either (1) use the mardown file of thier team on [our GitHub project repository](https://github.com/Sun-Young-Park/Election-Analytics) to edit their page or (2) upload thier pdf and tag it with the syntax: ```markdown [title](filename.pdf)``` Whenever they commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site.

## Timeline

Please update your team's blog every week by Tuesday night before class.
